Outage: Buildsystem Reboots and storage move 2013-01-30 22:00 UTC

There will be an outage starting at 2013-01-30 22:00 UTC, which will last approximately 2 hours.

To convert UTC to your local time, take a look at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/UTCHowto or run:

date -d '2013-01-30 22:00 UTC'

Reason for outage:

We will be updating servers and rebooting into the latest kernels. Additionally, we will be starting a backend ISCSI storage move for some machines. This move should complete in the background, but may result in some slower performance while it's running. Additionally, we will be upgrading the version of koji in use in our buildsystem to the latest upstream version.
